As-Is (Current) Claims Process Steps

This process is characterized by manual work, delays, and a lack
of transparency, leading to customer frustration.


1. Claim is Filed: The customer submits a claim, likely
through a manual process like a phone call, email, or a
physical form.
2. Initial Triage & Data Entry: A customer service
representative receives the claim and manually enters the
details into a claims management system.
3. Documentation Submissions: The representative
requests additional documentation from the customer, which
is often a slow, back-and-forth process.
4. Claim Hand-off: The claim is passed to a claims handler.
This hand-off is a manual process between departments.
5. Review and Assessment: The claims handler manually
reviews the claim and all supporting documentation. This is
where most delays occur due to inefficient processing, and
lack of resources.
6. Decision-Making: The claims handler makes a decision on
the claim, and the results are communicated to the customer.
7. Customer Communication: Customer service
representatives provide updates, but this is often
inconsistent and prone to miscommunication. The customer
has no way to track the claim on their own.
8. Claim Resolution: If the claim is approved, the company
processes the payment
